# VHS Redirector Scripts
_Scripts and GUIs to automate VHS Alternative Server. Needs Admin Privileges to run All scripts._


**VHS Server Coordinator GUI:**
-------------------------------
A GUI interface to modify the hosts file quickly and efficiently when switching server settings. Select Main to launch from the main private server, Self-Host to connect to a server on the local network, and Remote Server to connect to a IP address you provide.

All code can be found in vhs_gui.py if you are curious about how the program works. Everything else is just a wrapper or asset.
